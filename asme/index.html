                        ASME at UCLA challenges students to set new standards in the field of mechanical engineering, in all scopes--from individual development, to the Samueli Engineering community, to UCLA, to the rest of the world. Our purpose is to provide resources for students to build strong technical, professional, and social foundations in order to become contributors to the global community. <br><br>Two of our technical projects, FADE and Combat Robotics, require no experience to join as everything will be taught to you; it is very common for freshmen or new engineers to join both projects together as they complement each other nicely. Our professional events provide numerous opportunities to learn how to improve or write your resume, create and practice your elevator pitch, and land the dream internship or job. Our socials provide a supportive environment where you can make new friends taking the same classes as you and bond over various online activities and games.<br><br>ASME offers four hands-on projects: Fabrication and Design Essentials (FADE), Combat Robotics, X1 Robotics, and Bruin Underwater Robotics (BUR). These projects give you a variety of experiences for all skill levels that result in impressive projects that can be added to your resume. Our professional events include the annual MAExMSE Career Fair, individual company info sessions, and in-house workshops. All three of these types of events help give you structured feedback and constructive criticism from big company recruiters and successful upperclassmen/alumni. Our social events provide numerous opportunities to find fellow engineers to befriend and create unbreakable bonds as you take classes together and explore what it means to be an engineer.<br><br>If you have any questions, contact us any of the following:<br>Instagram: asmebruins<br>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/asmebruins<br>Email: asme.bruins@gmail.com<br>Website: asmebruins.com<br>Our newsletter will also keep you updated on upcoming events and opportunities throughout the quarter, and it is the best way to first get involved in the club.<br><br>If you want to join a project or learn more about upcoming social and professional events, come to our Fall Gm on Monday, October 5th at 6:00pm.
