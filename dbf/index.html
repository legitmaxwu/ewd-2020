                    <p class="card-tagline">In Design Build Fly at UCLA, students work together to design and manufacture a model RC airplane, both learning the theory behind how humans defy gravity and cultivating connections and friendships with fellow engineers of similar interests. Each year, the national AIAA organization hosts a Design Build Fly competition, during which the DBF team at UCLA designs a plane to complete certain missions; after manufacturing, the team travels to the midwest to compete in an international competition against 100 other schools.</p>

Join us for our kickoff meeting first week of class!</b><br>DBF Kickoff Meeting October 7th, 2020 at 6:00 PM<br>Zoom Link: <a href="https://ucla.zoom.us/j/97839943509">https://ucla.zoom.us/j/97839943509</a><br>Interest Form: <a href="https://forms.gle/uuLZALgquZ5SLvZW9">https://forms.gle/uuLZALgquZ5SLvZW9</a><p class="p-text-break">........</p>Mission<br>As an engineering club, DBF at UCLA aims to promote the application of theoretical engineering skills and scientific knowledge to a real-world situation, as well as the development of general technical and leadership skills. The club’s design and manufacturing activities act as a supplement to students’ engineering coursework, allowing them a taste of the industry many will enter after graduation. With effective and innovative design and creation, DBF also proudly represents UCLA engineering each year at the AIAA Design Build Fly competition.<p class="p-text-break">........</p><b>Hello, Younglings: Freshman Initiation Program<br>(aka why you shouldn’t worry even if you feel like you don’t know anything)</b><br>DBF has an extensive integrated training program during which experienced members help new members learn and develop all the skills necessary to be successful in the club. New members may also, if they so desire, immediately experience the innerworkings of the club by participating in our currently ongoing design process and preparation for this year’s competition. <p class="p-text-break">........</p><b>Club Events: What do we do other than building planes?</b><br>Each year, our club participates in the annual AIAA Design, Build, Fly competition; the team travels together to either Tuscon or Wichita in mid-April for a four day event that includes competing in ground and flight missions. Throughout the year, we have prototype fly days, social events, and professional development boards and presentations to promote team cohesion.
