                    <p class="card-tagline">The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) is a professional, networking, and social organization geared toward connecting students to the transportation industry. We provide two hands-on projects, field trips to transportation companies, information sessions with industry professionals, and a welcoming social environment to expose students to the network of urban planning and transportation engineering.</p>

                        Our mission is to connect students to the transportation industry and to each other. We strive to not only provide opportunities for students to grow into transportation professionals but also to have a close-knit community that creates lasting friendships and experiences.<p class="p-text-break">........</p>Our club welcomes all incoming students and beginners since there is no prior experience required. We try to help those that do not know much about transportation by developing technical knowledge through our projects, providing class planning workshops, and overall just having a community of leaders willing to help anyone learn and grow. We have also implemented an intern position, specifically for freshmen/transfer students who would like more hands-on experience to the operations of our club. Feel free to contact our Younger Member Outreach Chair & Intern Coordinator, Shaun Howard, at howardshaun47@gmail.com if this position interests you! <p class="p-text-break">........</p>Each year, our organization offers a career fair, company info sessions, socials, networking events, and opportunities to go to conferences. We also have two transportation projects to teach students about design, planning, and data collection.<p class="p-text-break">........</p>If you are interested in joining us, come check us out at our fall general meeting on October 8, 6 - 8 PM via zoom! We will be going more into detail about how you can get involved in our club and how to become a member. If you are interested, fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/3i2vjLT8DdHugDr87">form.</a>
