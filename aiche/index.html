                        The mission of the AIChE Student Chapter at UCLA is to provide resources and support to chemical engineering students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally. For new students, we offer a Chemical Engineering Introductory Project (ChIP) where participants learn and apply principles, such as process design and process controls, by building a small-scale chemical engineering system in teams. We also offer a Lifetime Engineering Applications Project (LEAP) where students model real-life industrial processes using PRO/II, a process simulation software. In Chem-E-Car, students research, design, experiment, and collaborate with team members to build a shoebox-sized car fueled and stopped purely by chemical reactions. Teams are composed of sophomores/second-year transfer students and above. Through our mentorship program, freshmen and first-year transfer students are paired with a mentor of similar interests and placed into families to help facilitate the transition into UCLA. Our family heads host events throughout the quarter to allow students to connect outside of classes. AIChE also hosts an Annual Career Fair in the fall, in addition to professional development workshops and information sessions with various companies throughout the year. Our 1st Fall General Meeting will be on October 6th, 6-8PM PST on Zoom. <p class="p-text-break">........</p>To become a member, simply submit your completed membership form and dues.
