                        Our mission is to provide an environment for all beginning and experienced developers, designers, data scientists, marketing experts, and product managers to expand their skill set and apply theoretical knowledge learned from the classrooms to build a real-world product from idea to execution. By drawing in a diverse range of students from various majors, we are committed to establish a close-knit network that lasts beyond graduation to assist our members’ professional endeavors.<p class="p-text-break">........</p>DevX teams have developed and deployed numerous successful products, such as BruinBite, StudyB, OnCampus, and VR Chess! Through our student-led teams, we have fostered a community of students with curious mindsets, cooperative attitudes, and entrepreneurial spirits.<p class="p-text-break">........</p>More than just a club, we ensure that DevX teams create an opportunity where all members of different skill levels, from beginning to experienced, can thrive. We offer an internal mentorship program where senior members who have acquired a diverse set of industry-standard skills and practices can share and guide junior members in their development journey.<p class="p-text-break">........</p>We regularly host tech talks, lunches, and recruiting events with major tech companies like Robinhood, Microsoft, etc. to connect our students with the industry through our alumni network. We also host a quarterly end-of-quarter Demo Day where teams can present and market their product to the UCLA community to receive user feedback which is then utilized to further refine their product.<p class="p-text-break">........</p>Come learn more about us at our Fall Infosession on <b>Wednesday, September 30th at 6 PM</b>. We will be discussing the projects that we have planned for the upcoming quarter along with releasing our application if you are interested in joining a team!
